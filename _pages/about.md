My name is Chevindu Wickramathilaka. I studied physical sciences in [Ananda College](https://www.anandacollege.edu.lk/), majored in Mechanical Engineering at [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/) and currently working as a software engineer at [Yaala Labs](https://yaalalabs.com/). That combo might not make sense to you, but such is my life.

You will find me on Twitter with occational updates on my cacti and hot takes on DC. Also, [#RestoreTheSnyderVerse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RestoreTheSnyderVerse).

Have something in mind? Hit me up.
